    "Replacing Oliver with Jessica has a noticeable impact on our estimates, particularly variance (+10). Given that 1 is a value that is significantly lower than the rest of the values in the set, it makes since that the variance has increased. However, I wouldn't consider 1 to be an extreme outlier. Therefore, I still feel that standard deviation is a good estimate of variance. (Interestingly, the standard error has remained unchanged from our original data set.) I also believe that the mean continues to be an appropriate measure of central tendency. It has changed in response to new data, but not drastically. The mode, as seen above, is easily eliminated when none of the values in the set are repeating. For that reason, I believe it is not the best measure of central tendency. "
